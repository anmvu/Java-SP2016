odbc - go between tool for database stuff
jdbc - communication between java and the db management system 
	- authentication
	- what data you can access and what you can do with that data
I don't feel like typing everything he says about databases...
row = tuple 

get mysql server and workbench

nothing native to connect to database
but all db management servers have jdcb library which can be included in the program to connect to the appropriate server


package database.jdbc1;
import java.io.*;
import java.sql.*;

public class Databases{
	
	public static void main(String [] args){
		Connection conn = null; //connection to sql server
		try{
			Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver").newInstance();//create new instance to have jdbc to connect to mysql
			String url = "jbdc:mysql:127.0.0.1/cs391";
			String dbuser = "cs391";
			String dbpass = "password";
			conn = DriverManagerConnection(url,dbuser,dbpass);
			//to advance the result set at least once, must get result set
			Statement s = conn.createStatement();
			s.executeQuery("Select * from test;");
			ResultSet rs = s.getResultSet();
			while(rs.next()){
				int tid = rs.getInt("TID");
				String motto = rs.getString("Motto");
				System.out.println("tid: "+ tid + "\tMotto: "+ motto);
			}
			rs.close();
			s.close();
			s = conn.createStatement();
			s.execute("INSERT INTO TEST(MOTTO, NNum) VALUES("Hello", '11111'));
		}catch(Exception e){
			System.out.print('Connection error: '+e.toString());
		}finally{
			try{
				conn.close();
				System.out.println("Connection Closed!");
			}catch(Exception e){}
		}
	}
}
